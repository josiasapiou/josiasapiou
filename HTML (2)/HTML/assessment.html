    <p>For the test, you will be asked to hold your phone vertically against your chest for 15 seconds while standing on one leg (demonstrated by the image above). Try to avoid leaning or putting your foot down during the test. Once you click the button below, hold your phone against your chest. A voice will count down to let you know when the test is starting so you can put your foot up. Hold this position as best you can for 15 seconds until the voice tells you the test is over. Click the button below to begin you balance assessment.</p>
